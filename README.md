# Pyspark_Project
### In this project, I carried out a simple data analysis using Pyspark. Pyspark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source distributed computing framework designed for processing big data. Spark can handle large-scale data processing tasks efficiently by distributing computations across a cluster of computers. Key features of Pyspark include;
### 1. Distributed Computing: Data is Split across multiple machines for parallel processing, which improves performance. 
    2.In-Memory Processing: Spark processes data in memory, which speeds up computations compared to traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop
    3.
    


### The first time I analyzed data with pyspark, I noticed it is quite similar to the analyzing data with Pandas library in Python.The obvious differences that I noticed then was that You have to Initialize a SparkSession before you start and You have to Stop the SparkSession when you are done. Some of the other differences between Pyspark and Pandas include;
